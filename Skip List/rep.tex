\paragraph{Skip List}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item \textbf{Overview of the code}

Skip lists  are a probabilistic list-based data structure that are a simple and efficient substitute for balanced trees.
\begin{description}
  \item[Insertion: I skiplist key "data"]
To insert  a node, we simply search and splice. A vector update is maintained so that when the search is complete (and we are ready to perform the splice), update[i] contains a pointer to the rightmost node of level i or higher that is to the left of the location of the
insertion. If an insertion generates a node with a level greater than the previous maximum level of the list, we update the maximum level of the list and initialize the appropriate portions of the update vector.

Time Complexity :: \textbf{O$\left( log_2N \right)$}
  \item[Search: S skiplist key]
We search for an element by traversing forward pointers that do not overshoot the node containing the element being searched for. When no more progress can be made at the current level of forward pointers, the search moves down to the next level. When we can make no more progress at level 1, we must be immediately in front of the node that contains the desired element (if it is in the list).
  
 Time Complexity :: \textbf{O$\left( log_2N \right)$}
  \item[ioTraverse: T skiplist]
ioTraverse function traverses the skiplist from left to right in increasing order of keys.
Time Complexity :: \textbf{O$\left( N \right)$}
  \item[Delete: D skiplist key]
Deletion Algorithm is almost same as Insertion. But in deletion after each deletion, we check if we have deleted the
maximum element of the list and if so, decrease the maximum level of the list.

Time Complexity :: \textbf{O$\left( log_2N \right)$}
  \item[Mergel: M ]
Merge Operation merges both a and b skiplists by inserting the elements of one skiplist to the another sequentially.

Time Complexity :: \textbf{O$\left(M* log_2N \right)$}
